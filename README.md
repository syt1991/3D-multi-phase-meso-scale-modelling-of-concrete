## Keywords:
Abaqus; Python script; Mayavi; three-dimensional (3D) meso-scale model; multi-phase material

## Introduction
I'd like to share some codes from my research. <br>
When the paper is finished, the open-source code will be available. <br>
## Packages requirements
Packages, including numpy, scipy, and mayavi are needed.
Inp files with ordered element numbers in Abaqus should also be prepared first. <br>
## Coding
Waiting...<br>
## Some results
