## Keywords:
Abaqus; Python script; Mayavi; three-dimensional (3D) meso-scale model; multi-phase material

## Introduction
I'd like to share some codes from my research and hope it helps. <br>
An numerical modeling framework was proposed to generate highly realistic 3D mesoscale multi-phase concrete models with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. <br>
Our framework achieved a significant wide range in aggregate volume fraction (0 to 80%) and featuring rapid model generation capabilities, 
and extemely reduce computational timeâ€”achieving simulations of 1 million elements within mere 30 s on readily available hardware. <br>
## Packages requirements
Packages, including numpy, scipy, and mayavi are needed.
Inp files with ordered element numbers in Abaqus should also be prepared first. <br>
## Coding
See main.py file.<br>
## Some results
